Howdy!

There comes a time in your life where you just need to write out your thoughts on personal trials and tribulations, lest you forget them and need to relive these lessons, particularly if these lessons come in the form of "one-time" scripts you wrote or solutions scraped together from several posts from derelict forums you swore you invoked necromancy to find.

I predict this blog will likely be steps on how I completed a certain project or setup configurations, sprinkled with reflections when life gets interesting.

There will probably be a secondary website for jotting down notes and things that are too short to warrant an entire post.

Posts will probably be infrequent until I figure out how I want to format this blog and what platform it will be on for the foreseeable future, but didn't feel quite right to leave this default Github Pages Jekyll blog empty until that time.

> Things worth doing are worth doing well. But it's also worth doing something rather than nothing at all.

For now I'll leave you with some of my favourite things to type into my terminal.

{% highlight bash %}
git status
pwd
git add .
ls -alh
git commit
cd ~
{% endhighlight %}
